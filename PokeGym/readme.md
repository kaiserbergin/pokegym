# PokeProject

PokeProject is a wonderfully amazing, life-altering, groundbreaking pile of code to help with learning stuff.  I mean, it doesn't like _work_ or anything, but what else would you expect?

# Test Project

Keep tests running while you code!  In your command line run:
```
 dotnet watch -p ./PokeGymTests/ test
```

Tests currently run tests for the repository and controller via XUnit.  Some useful links for what we've done here so far:
